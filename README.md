# How to use this template repo

The files in this repo can be used to help you get started in at least two ways:

* You can select the repo as a template when creating a new Github repo - simply select in in the `Repository Template` dropdown.
* You can copy the files you want to an already existing repository.

## How to customize the template files

Always make sure to look through the template files and adapt them to your project before use. For example, you should remove the first section of this README :) You might also want to change the disposition, add more content, graphics, etc. It's up to you, but make sure to always include the **Project description**, **License information** and **List of Creators / Maintainers** as a minimum.
